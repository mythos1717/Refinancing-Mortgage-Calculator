## Mortgage Refinance Calculator

Contributors: Cassie Witt

## Description

This mortgage refinance calculator was built to work with an existing API that does the actual refinancing calculations. I've take out all the information that pertains to the API because of a Non-disclosure agreement. It is not a working piece of code because of this, but is an example of what I have built in the past. It was originally incorporated into Wordpress and uses another plugin to acheieve the printing of the refinancing information. For more information please email me at witt.cassie@gmail.com and I will be happy to answer any questions.
